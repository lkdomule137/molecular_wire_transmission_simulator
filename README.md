# Molecular Wire Transmission Simulator

The following repository contains a MATLAB GUI to calculate the transmission of a molecular wire
as a function of energy. **Note: the use of this software requires a valid MATLAB license and takes input files from Gaussian16.**
Sample Gaussian16 calculations are provided to see the proper format and process for preparing input files.
Explicit instructions for completing calculations can be found in the document titled, Transmission_Simulation_User_Manual.pdf.
